# NSMetadataQuery ubiquitous external documents

**Warning: this code does not currently work. This repo is intended to
demonstrate an issue.**

This repository holds a minimal test project to demonstrate the use of
NSMetadataQuery to monitor the file system for changes to external
(imported) folders.

## Running this code

To run this code, make sure to replace all instances of `AnnotateML`
and `iCloud.com.stevemarshall.AnnotateML` with references to an iCloud
bucket you own.
